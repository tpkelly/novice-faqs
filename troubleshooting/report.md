### How do I report someone causing trouble?

If you feel someone has broken the rules, you can report them to the GMs through the **/supportdesk**.

Have a look through the "Frequently Asked Questions" section before you begin, as these may help file your report in the correct category. If nothing fits, use the "Contact us" tab to file a report to a GM.

You may receive a notification back from the GM that your report was received and is being processed, although you should not expect to hear how your report was resolved.

Sometimes the GM may send you private messages to try and clarify the situation, but you should not expect this to happen.
