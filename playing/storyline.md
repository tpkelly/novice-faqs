### Where is my next storyline quest?

![Main Story Quest icon](http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/ffxiv-new/images/d/d7/MSQuests.png/revision/latest?cb=20130828211302)

This icon indicates a Main Story Quest. The next quest will always continue from where the last one finished, but some may be locked to a level requirement.

You can see where the next quest will be in your **/journal** or **/recommended** list of quests.

If you haven't picked up your latest quest and don't remember where you left off, go to the "Complete" tab in your journal to find out what the last quest name was and either search for it on [Gamer Escape](http://ffxiv.gamerescape.com/wiki/) or ask in the chat which quest comes next.
