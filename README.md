# A guide for new adventurers

Welcome to the guide!

I've been an active Mentor on Lich since the system was introduced, and time and time again I see the same questions coming up. I decided to compile some of the more common questions with some quick tips for playing.

If you want to reach me in game, I am Kazenone Alagar of Lich server. I am only a player, and I am not affiliated with Square Enix in any way.

Happy hunting!
