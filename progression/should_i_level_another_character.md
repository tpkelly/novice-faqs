# Should I level another character?
In short, you don't need to but that shouldn't stop you. FFXIV allows you to level all classes to max rank on a single character, and there are benefits to doing so. This should not stop you from creating alts on other worlds if you want to visit other friends.

To change class, simply change the weapon you have currently equipped to the weapon from that class. You have to have the new class unlocked before you are able to do so.

Changing your class may unequip the gear you currently have. In order to keep these saved you can set up a gearset.

On your character profile above the weapon is a button to access gearsets. Opening this up and clicking the "+" in the top left saves your gear as a new gearset.

It is recommended you rename your gearset to something which you could type on your keyboard (E.g. "Gladiator").
- You can then change to equip all items in this gearset by using the command "/gearset equip Gladiator".
- You start with only a few slots for gearsets available, but unlock a new slot when you unlock new classes.
