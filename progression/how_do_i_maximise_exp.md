### How do I maximise exp?

### Battles
Quests will give you xp, you should pick them up when you find them. Dungeons give you a constant feed of xp, and can be a great way too.

The hunting log can give massive xp bonuses for killing just a handful of enemies.

The challenge log (/challengelog) has a set of small tasks which can earn bonus xp if completed, such as "Complete 5 dungeons". These challenges reset once per week.

Duty roulettes give an xp bonus in exchange for randomising the duty you participate in (Available after level 16). The bonus is available once per day.

FATEs appear periodically in zones outside of towns, and give an xp bonus for participating (even if you fail to complete it). The more you fight in a FATE, the more of a bonus you get for contribution Your bonus depends on how much your party does, not just yourself so partying up can help.

Killing monsters/mobs in quick succession earns an xp chain bonus, but the higher the chain the less time you have to kill the next monster.

### Bonuses
- **+30% xp bonus under level 30** for completing the Hall of the novice and earning a [Brand-new Ring](http://ffxiv.gamerescape.com/wiki/Brand-new_Ring) at the end.
- **+3% xp for 30 minutes** by eating food.
- **+50% xp from rested bonus**, earned by logging out in a sanctuary (town or city) with a moon symbol on the exp bar.
- **+10% xp**: after joining a Free Company (aka Guild), you may get a +10% exp bonus from Company Action buffs, which last 24 hours. Some smaller guilds can't afford to keep this on 24/7, so you may want to ask ['How do I choose a guild to join?'](../playing/guilds.html).
- **+20% xp under level 25** if you [invited or invite a friend](http://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/special/friend_recruit/) to play, earning you both the [Friendship Circlet](http://ffxiv.gamerescape.com/wiki/Friendship_Circlet).
- **+20% xp under level 20** if a mentor and new adventurer are fighting together in a dungeon, FATE, guildhest or in the open world.
- **+100% bonus under level 50** when leveling a second class. If the class is a lower level than another class you have, you will earn an xp bonus until it catches up. Above level 50 this still applies but the bonus is +50%.
